# Web Framework

This is a generic web framework project, developed to facilitate the creation of forms and other user interfaces. The framework was built with **TypeScript**, offering strong typing and an organized structure.

## Features

The main goal of this project is to provide a set of simple and reusable tools for building web components, such as forms. Current features include:

- **Modular structure**: The project's architecture allows components to be created and managed independently.
- **DOM integration**: Direct manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) to render and update the interface.
- **Strict typing**: The use of TypeScript ensures the code is more robust and easier to maintain.
